Introduction

The Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Model utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast the number of bike rentals based on various features. The model can be configured to use either a Random Forest or Linear Regression algorithm, providing flexibility based on the specific requirements of the user.
Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    Scikit-learn
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Jupyter Notebook (for development and visualization)

Install dependencies using:

bash

pip install scikit-learn

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/kushagra8881/bike-sharing-predictionn.git
cd bike-sharing-demand



Usage

Follow these steps to use the Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Model:

    Data Preparation: Ensure you have the historical bike sharing data, including features like weather conditions, time, and day of the week.

    Model Selection: Choose between Random Forest and Linear Regression. Update the configuration accordingly in the code.

    Training: Run the training script to train the model on historical data.

    Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on future bike sharing demand.

Refer to the Usage section in the documentation for detailed instructions.
Model Options

The model supports two algorithms:

    Random Forest: Ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

    Linear Regression: Linear approach to modeling the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

Update the configuration in the code to choose the desired algorithm.
Data

The model requires historical bike sharing data, including features such as weather conditions, time, and day of the week. Ensure the data is preprocessed and formatted correctly.
Training

To train the model, execute the training script and provide the path to the historical bike sharing data.

bash

python train.py --data_path /path/to/bike_sharing_data.csv

Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script. This will provide metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualization of predicted vs. actual demand.

bash

python evaluate.py --model_algorithm random_forest --model_checkpoint /path/to/model_checkpoint

Results

Document the results of the model predictions and include visualizations in the Results section.
